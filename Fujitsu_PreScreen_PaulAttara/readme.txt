Fujitsu Canada Prescreening Questions

Hi,

Thank you for considering me as a candidate for 2019 Summer Software Development Internship 

Attached, you will find a file called EReport.py that is written in python and runs in the command line.

To run it, type in the following:
    #python ./EReport.py filename 

Best,
Paul Attara
