Write a windows compatible application that reads a text file containing employee information and outputs the sorted data to the console.
Input file format:

- Comments are preceded by the '#' (hash-tag) character
- The data consists of an employee number and employee name separated by a ',' (comma)
delimiter
- The employee name consists of first and last name separated by a ' ' (space) delimiter

An example of the input text file:
############################################### #
# Employee information
# Employee number, employee name
102,Mary Major 103,Zachery Zoe 101, John Doe 104,Joe Public 110,Carla Coleman


Requirements:
1. The input file "employees.dat" (sample attached) must be loaded from the same directory where the application exists
2. The input file content should not be modified
3. Sort the input file contents by employee number and send the output to the console
4. Sort the input file contents alphabetically by employee last name and send the output to the
console
5. Do not include comments in the sorted output
6. Each employee record on a separate line
7. Each line consists of Employee number, Employee Name
8. The console application name should be “EReport”


An example of the expected output:


Processing by employee number... 101,John Doe
102,Mary Major
103,Zachery Zoe
104,Joe Public 110,Carla Coleman

Processing by last (family) Name... 110,Carla Coleman
101,John Doe
102,Mary Major
